## Project 1: The Elevator Interface

### Requirements for a grade of C:
- Elevator was found in a parking garage in Austin, Texas. Below are some images of the control interface.

- Here is a gif of the control interface in action.


- Current design issues: 
  -	The lobby names are not represented in braille
  -	Not everyone will know what “B” stands for
  -	Door open and close buttons do not light up when pressed
  -	Door open and close buttons do not seem to work, no response when pressed other than the button going in
  -	Very top button may be hard to reach for people in wheelchairs
  -	Current floor screen quite high up, those in wheelchairs may have to strain neck to see it
  -	Random black square below controls, may confuse users into thinking it has functionality (could possibly be a camera)
  -	Current floor can be hard to read since its white text on a bright blue background
  -	Elevator only “dings” when travelling between floors. A voice relaying what floor its currently on would better help those who are visually impaired
  
  
- What the design does well:
  -	Floor control buttons provide obvious feedback when pressed
  -	Braille is used to help visually impaired use the elevator
  -	Feedback is provided to let you know your current floor location
  -	One simple help button, some elevators have multiple, and this may confuse users
  -	Emergency button is colored red
  -	Information board above controls letting users know what is located on each floor
  -	Some floors have additional labels beyond numbers
