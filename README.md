# Project 2: Personal Magic Mirror

## Requirements for a grade of C:
- I designed my mirror using a column style grid to allow the design to be uniform and coherent. All controls line the sides of the mirror so that
it can still be used as a simple mirror when the user stands in the middle.

### Design Choices
#### Clock
The clock was designed to be simple and easy to read.

## Requirements for a grade of B:
### Common elevator uses:
  -	Travel up to higher floors
  -	Travel down to lower floors
  -	Used by handicapped people so they may easily go up/down floors
  -	Transport large or heavy objects up and down floors
  -	Close doors with the close doors button
  -	Open doors with the open doors button<br>

This elevators interface makes performing these common task simple for me, however that may not be the case for everyone. For example the buttons on this elevator are quite vertical, meaning those in wheel chairs may not be able to perform these common task. 
  
### Rare:
  -	Using the elevator emergency call button to get assistance if there’s an issue with the elevator
  -	Use the emergency alarm button to alert someone that you are stuck in the elevator
  -	Press emergency stop button to immediately cut power to elevator motors and apply the brakes

### Common action sequences:
  1.	Press elevator call button
  2.	Enter elevator and select desired floor (may read information panel before selecting floor)
  3.	If no one is nearby, press close door button. Otherwise, wait for other users to perform their actions
  4.	Look at current floor screen and wait for elevator to arrive at your floor
  5.	Exit elevator

### How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?

  This elevator does a pretty good job in helping users understand how to use it by providing a large information panel on which floors have what locations. This will help users understand they need to press the corresponding floor button to get to the location they desire. There is a very limited number of controls, and all of them are labeled with either text or symbols. The emergency button could benefit from some text saying emergency on it, but it does give the impression that the button calls for help due to it being red with a phone icon on it. The floor controls provide useful feedback to let users know a floor has been selected. 
  
### How does the elevator provide feedback to users?

This elevator provides feedback to users in a visual, audible, and tactile manner. When using one of the buttons on the controls users can feel the button going in. A light ring around the button will then activate, letting users know they have selected a floor. While the elevator is traveling, a sound effect will trigger each time it arrives at a new floor, letting visually impaired individuals know that the elevator is moving between floors.

### What are some possible mistakes users could make with the current interface?

With this design, you could easily make the mistake that the close door buttons work when they in fact do not do anything at all. Users who do not know what “B” represents may be scared to access those floors and not travel to them. 

### Improvement suggestions and my justification
Since I will be creating a touch screen interface in processing, I decided to make my improvements with a touch screen in mind. Below are some of the improvements I made using a sketch:
  -	Took advantage of the fact that touch screens can scroll by a user swiping. I made it so the screen could take up less space, saving money and allowing disabled users to easily reach it
  -	I made it obvious that more floor options were available by adding arrows showing that more options are above and below
  -	Side controls such as emergency and door controls are separate from floors so users won't accidentally press them trying to change floors
  -	Floors are labeled with words instead of just letters and numbers which helps users better understand their purpose
  -	Current floor is shown right above the controls, all useful information in one place rather than split
  -	Easy to read font and colors allowing users to quickly gather control information

## Requirements for a grade of A:
My elevator touch screen has a size of 650px by 490px. This may seem small but I have a good reason for choosing this screen size. I want those in wheelchairs to be 
able to easily use my interface, so I made sure to make it compact, without compromising on the information it provides. I took full advantage of the interface being
a touch screen by allowing users to swipe to see all possible floors. Census.gov states that 84% of Americans own a smart device, meaning they have experience using touch screens and would not have to learn how to use my interface. I also supply arrows pointing in the direction that more information is available so users will not miss any floors. I believe I have a unique interface that is handicap friendly and relays all the important information someone could want from an elevator.
